            <h3>Trump Locked Out Of White House After Accidentally Revoking Own Security Clearance</h3>
            <p>
                Growing increasingly flustered while impotently pounding on the front door and pleading to come inside, President Trump was
                reportedly locked out of the White House Thursday after accidentally revoking his own security clearance.

                President Trump is apparently moving forward on his controversial proposal to create a space force as the sixth branch of
                the U.S. military, with members of his administration beginning to discuss how it would function. We take
                a look at the pros and cons of developing a space force.

            WASHINGTON—Following the release of official reports that attributed 2,975 deaths to the 2017 storm instead of the previous
            estimate of 64, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was revoking a significant amount of funding
            devoted to Puerto Rico after learning that Hurricane Maria had way fewer survivors. “The new data shows that
            there are substantially less people than we thought who are still alive, which means they don’t need as much
            money to help each of them recover,” said Trump, adding that he was slashing the $18.5 billion earmarked for
            the island’s recovery by the Department of Housing and Urban Development by at least $12 billion to $15 billion
            since “now they don’t need as much food and houses and stuff.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We want to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from this massive, massive storm, but it’s too late to help people recover
            if they’re already dead. And, look, I’m not saying the people of Puerto Rico were lying to get more money, but
            it’s pretty suspicious that they waited until now to tell us how many more people died. At least finding out
            about the hurricane death toll now means a lot of American money will be saved.” Trump added that the people
            of Puerto Rico should be pleased about the reduced recovery funding, since there would be less U.S. money wasted
            there the next time a massive hurricane hits.
