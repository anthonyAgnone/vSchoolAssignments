        Ruin has come to our family.


        You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor.


        I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began 
        to tire of... conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway 
        to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and 
        recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen 
        and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that 
        damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of 
        death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. 
        Until consciousness failed me.


        You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, 
        claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows... 
        
        of the Darkest Dungeon.

        You will arrive along the old road.


        It winds with a troubling, serpent-like suggestion through the corrupted countryside, leading only, I fear, 
        to ever more tenebrous places. There is a sickness in the ancient, pitted cobbles of the old road, and on 
        its writhing path, you'll face viciousness, violence and perhaps, other damnably transcendent terrors.
        
        
        So, steel yourself, and remember, there can be no bravery without madness. The old road will take you to 
        hell, but, in that gaping abyss, we will find our redemption.
